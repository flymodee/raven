I know what I did was unacceptable and I wasn't literal. I just want to explain again what exactly happened and just be as clear as possible.

I was talking to people in discord and they noticed she was streaming so I opened it and watched a couple mintues with the people in discord. I never talked to her or watched anymore of her streams or anything else. I didn't have her added or follow her. 

The way I handled it was terrible and not ok. I'm sorry for not being literal and truthful and clear and using the wrong wording.
