## Times I objectified you and viewed you the same 

  - When we were hanging out at tufts and sitting on a bench I kept touching your body sexually, like grabbing your boobs and curves and started off doing that
  - One time specifically when I saw you after redbones you were wearing the pants that had holes and I didn't stop putting my hands down them,
  thats all I was doing that time I was just focused on your body
  - During 2020 before we had done stuff I constantly sent you sexual things like what I would want to do with you, only a few months after we started dating.
  All these times I was seeing you the same way as other people I objectified and me not being comfortable and wanting to stopped me from acting more like that
  - When you were with your dad in the summer of 2020 one of the few things I actually asked for/about was pictures/videos of you to do stuff too
  - At that time I wasn't calling you enough and one of the things I did call for was seeing your body and objectifying it
  - I spent alot of time looking at you and your Instagram and just looking at your body, seeing you as an object the same way I did anime girls and other people
  - That objectification was what I asked for from you and how I saw you 
  - Even before we were going out I saw you like that I think I paid more attention to you visually than I did talking to you and treating you like a friend even though I held myself back
